                <h1>Basant in greek means "The beautiful flower", in hindi it means "Spring", and generally Basant is a type of flowers called "Pansies". In Floriography aka The flower language, Pansy flowers represent the thoughts of lovers. It symbolizes thoughts, remeberance, and love. It's also said that pansy is a charmed flower that posses telepathic magic, and that using pansies you can hear your lover's thoughts. During the Victorian era, the pansy was a popular flower, and victorians used it often in bouquets to express sentiments, moreover, Shakespeare used pansies in one of his writings: In A Midsummer Night's Dream, "The juice of a pansy is used to create a love potion, indicating the flower's association with love and enchantment." Another fun fact about pansies is that it blooms in the early spring which is in Egypt from late March to early April, so being born on the 2nd of April is such a wonderful coincedence. However, aside from all those indescribably marvellous facts about Basant, you're my favourite Basant ever <3.</h1>
