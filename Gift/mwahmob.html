I always try to impress you ka2en I just saw you w I'm trying to make you love me. I love everything about you, I just admire you and adore you. Loving you is a mixed feeling between feeling fresh love such as excitement, and getting butterflies (7alawet el bedayat) and between feeling stable and safe around you (Home). It's like you're a mixture between being my crush, and my wife. Notice en kol da I'm talking about only one topic, w that's why b2olk words can't describe my love to you. If I had an assignment to write about how much I love you, I'll have to write a book with a minimum of 500 pages everyday until I pass away, and then I'll fail my assignment because it wasn't enough. Ana fe3lan msh 3aref when to stop l2n I can keep going till the next day, w sorry lw el page dy shaklha msh kwy bas 3lshan el klam da kolo akeed hy2sr fy el HTML.

Looking at your eyes make me feel that I'm flying amongst the stars and it makes me feel that I'm drowning in the deepest ocean ever, maybe the best sentence to describe what I feel when I look into your eyes is that I'm drowning with the stars, t7esy en feh galaxies kteer w enta you're drowning kda in the space with them, as if your eye is a black whole absorbing me along with the stars into your iris.
